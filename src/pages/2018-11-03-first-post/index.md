Yay! First post here!

First of all, welcome to my personal developer log! I plan on writing about my struggles and adventures as a developer. I have a funny way of learning things and that's by writing up tutorial-like posts about a topic. My mission is to write up small short sized tutorials in my log and hopefully learn a thing or two. Who knows, maybe you can use my content and learn something from it as well!
