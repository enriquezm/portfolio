Are you familiar with the 100 Days challenge? You might have seen it on while scrolling through twitter or maybe even on github. Well I started the 100DaysofX challenge and felt like it was missing something. Documenting was a little of a pain form me so I wanted to create an app that was simple, to the point, and helped me organize and keep track of how far along the challenge I was.

Say hello to Habit Rabbit!

Habit Rabbit is a simple react app that takes the contributing visualizations of github and combines it with the 100days Challenge.
