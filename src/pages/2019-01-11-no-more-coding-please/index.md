excerpt: "Sometimes, I don't feel like coding. And that's okay."

There are weeks where I'm a coding god. I can just sling out algorithms left and right and build out some sick interfaces. I'm just driven and focused and super motivated. And then there are weeks where I just don't want to code at all. I don't want to write any code, deal with logic or anything of the sort.

Before, I would take this as a sign that maybe coding was just not for me. They say to think of someething you could find yourself doing every day, and do that. While I'm not against doing this, I do feel like no matter what you choose in life, it's going to have it's ups and downs.

So for the past year, I focused on being mindful in my life, and picked up on a couple things I wanted to share to help you take a break, but not completely de-rail from coding.

## 1. It's Okay to Take a Break

Look, I get it. We all want to be the best in what we do and the feeling of taking a step back while others continue on forward is hard to take. Here's the thing, there is no one path that all humans should take, every one is in their own journey on their own time.

Just do you booboo.

## 2. Poking into different areas is great

## 3. Exercise
