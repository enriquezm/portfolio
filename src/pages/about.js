      <p>Man I hate writing about myself...</p>
      <p>Let's see...</p>
      <p>I'm a frontend developer focused on designing and building user interfaces.</p>
      <p>I have a bunch of projects out there on the interwebs. You can find some stuff on <a href="https://codepen.io/mylesenri/">codepen</a> or <a href="https://codesandbox.io/u/enriquezm">codesandbox</a>. I mainly develop with React but have worked with other frameworks in the past.</p>
      <p>Most of my inspiration comes from 80s hacker movies and don't even get me started on cyberpunk movies.</p>
