# Super mES

Short for Super Myles Enriquez System. I know, lame. But Super mES is my personal blog and portfolio.

This portfolio is based of the Gatsby starter over at the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site.

Run Super mES (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
```
gatsby new enriquezm-portfolio https://github.com/enriquezm/portfolio
```

Or [view the current status here](https://pensive-lamport-06727c.netlify.com/).

## Running in development
`gatsby develop`
